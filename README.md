# Mureq: Agricultural Chatbot

This agricultural chatbot named Mureq provides knowledge and support in the field of agriculture, especially ornamental plants and
 trees in Saudi Arabia. This chatbot is powered by an AraBERT-based Question-Answering
 (QA) model, fine-tuned for the agricultural domain. This model was seamlessly integrated with
 a Retriever-Reader architecture, facilitated by the Haystack framework.
